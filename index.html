				<h2>Odd Paladin</h2>
				<p class="class1">Odd Paladin is one of the most viable aggro decks in the current Hearthstone Meta. It's hero power allows you to flood the board with small minions, that then become viable threats when partnered with cards such as "Level Up!" and "Stormwind Champion". The overall gameplan of the deck aims to play as many minions as possible the quickest that you can. You want to kill them with aggresive burst damage before they can access their survivability tools.</p>

				<h2>Even Shaman</h2>
				<p class="class1">Even Shaman plays out as hybrid between a midrange and an aggro deck. You aim to flood the board early with your cheap hero power, and then buff the totems with cards such as "Flametongue Totem". It also has midrange support in the form of cards such as "Alakir" and "The Lich King". "Corpse Taker" also provides a lot of survivability to help against aggro decks.</p>

				<h2>Odd Rogue</h2>
				<p class="class1">Odd Rogue is an aggro deck. It looks to use it's hero power for tempo, to kill your enemies minions, and also face damage to end the game. It has extremely viable game-ending burst damage with combos such as "Leeroy Jenkins" mixed with "Cold Blood".</p>

				<h2>Zoo Warlock</h2>
				<p class="class1">Zoo Warlock is all about flooding the board early. You cheat out free minions with cards such as "Happy Ghoul" and buff them with cards such as "Soul Infusion". You can finish the game with desperate card draw with "The Soularium".</p>
